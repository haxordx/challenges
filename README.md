# Haxor DX Bug Bounty

> Haxor is a community of developers that helps the maintainers of devtools improve their developer experience (DX).

## Welcome

Hello and welcome to the Haxor DX Bug Bounty! 

As a member of Haxor, you get to learn about new tools, help influence their future, and **earn swag and prizes**! Every bug we find helps the next developer save time.

Here you level up and earn prizes by learning new APIs, SDKs, and developer tools. The feedback you provide helps maintainers improve their products, documentation, and resources.

Our feedback sessions are called challenges. Every challenge asks you to build a small app or add a single feature using a developer tool. Every challenge takes between 15 minutes to 2 hours and you complete them on your own machine, with your own IDE! So come learn new skills, help other developers, and earn some prizes along the way!

# How It Works

Everyone is welcome to participate in our challenges. Giving feedback is as easy as opening a GitHub issue. You can file feedback for anything that you feel is "friction" to completing your task. 

- Things you expected to work that didn't
- Confusing or outdated instructions
- Spelling and syntax errors in documentation and code samples
- Website UI that doesn't work

Your experience will help maintainers improve their tools and remove friction for the next developer. And remember, developer experience uses many tools and is different for everyone.

# Earning Prizes

Everyone is welcome to participate in Haxor Challenges at any level.

In order to earn points, your issue must meet our minimum quality standards (MQS). Our quality standards exist to ensure that maintainers get a valuable amount of context and our system isn't being gamed.

- Regular Feedback is worth 1 point.
- Feedback with a Replayable replay attached is worth 2 points.

# About

Haxor started when I wondered "how can we reward developers for participating in open source?" Then I realized that developer experience in itself was valuable to the maintainers of dev tools, but there wasn't a great way for developers to share their experience. So I started Haxor, an developer testing agency while building Replayable, a tool that makes sharing context instant.

For 3 years Haxors has privately been helping open-source projects and companies like AWS, Snap, and Mailchiump get feedback from developers who try their tools. Now we're excited to bring Haxor to the larger open-source community with the help of our scren recording tool, Replayable.
