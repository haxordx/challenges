# Haxor DX Bug Bounty

> Haxor is a community of developers that helps the maintainers of devtools improve their developer experience (DX).

## Welcome

Hello and welcome to the Haxor DX Bug Bounty! 

As a member of Haxor, you get to learn about new tools, help influence their future, and **earn swag and prizes**! Every bug we find helps the next developer save time.

Here you level up and earn prizes by learning new APIs, SDKs, and developer tools. The feedback you provide helps maintainers improve their products, documentation, and resources.

Our feedback sessions are called challenges. Every challenge asks you to build a small app or add a single feature using a developer tool. Every challenge takes between 15 minutes to 2 hours and you complete them on your own machine, with your own IDE! So come learn new skills, help other developers, and earn some prizes along the way!

# How It Works

Everyone is welcome to participate in our challenges. Giving feedback is as easy as opening a GitHub issue. You can file feedback for anything that you feel is "friction" to completing your task. 

- Things you expected to work that didn't
- Confusing or outdated instructions
- Spelling and syntax errors in documentation and code samples
- Website UI that doesn't work

Your experience will help maintainers improve their tools and remove friction for the next developer. And remember, developer experience uses many tools and is different for everyone.
