# Haxor DX Bug Bounty

Hello and welcome to the Haxor DX Bug Bounty! Haxor is a community of developers that helps the maintainers of devtools improve their developer experience.

As a member of Haxor, you get to learn about new tools, help influence their future, and earn swag and prizes along the way! Every bug we find helps the next developer save time.

Our feedback sessions are called Haxor Challenges. Every Haxor Challenge is like an unboxing video of a new developer product youâ€™ve never used before. Each challenge asks you to build a small app or add a single feature using a developer tool.

Here you level up and earn prizes by learning new APIs, SDKs, and developer tools. The feedback you provide helps maintainers improve their products, documentation, and resources.

Our feedback sessions are called Haxor Challenges. Each challenge asks you to build a small app or add a single feature using a developer tool you probably haven't tried before.

Every challenge takes between 15 minutes to 2 hours and you complete them on your own machine, with your own IDE! Currently the only languages we support are Javascript and Java.

So come learn new skills, help other developers, and earn some prizes along the way!
