## Welcome <a id="welcome"></a>

Hello and welcome to the Haxor DX Bounty! Here you get to try new dev tools, help make them better, and **earn prizes**! Every bug we find helps the next developer save time! The feedback you provide helps maintainers improve their DX.

## How It Works

Try to complete the [challenges](#challenges) below. As you complete a challenge, you can file any feedback or bugs you find as issues in the challenge repo. Once you complete the challenge, you can make a pull request adding yourself to the leaderboard!

In order to earn points for an issue or pull, you'll need to attach a desktop replay clip using [Replayable](https://replayable.io?betacode=1337HAXOR). Replays help maintainers understand the context of your feedback and they help our moderators validate you submissions.

# Earning Points <a id="points"></a>

Mostly everything happens on GitHub (but you should also join our Discord!). You can see a list of challenges below. Each challenge will include it's own time estimate and goal.

> Replayable makes it simple to add context to bugs and pull requests without ruining your flow. Instead of spending time trying to reproduce a bug in a new screencast, Replayable lets you add footage from when you encountered it the first time. It works full pull requests and demos too! Check out our CLI and Chrome Extension for GitHub and Jira.

In order to earn points for your submission, it must contain a 30-second or longer screencast demoing the bug, feedback, or feature.

### Feedback (10 Points)<a id="points-feedback"></a>

> 10 points per GitHub Issue, 30 points max per challenge

Giving feedback to maintainers is the whole point of Haxor. It's as easy as opening a GitHub issue against the Haxor challenge repo. You can file feedback for anything that you feel is "friction" to completing your task

- Things you expected to work that didn't
- Confusing or outdated instructions
- Spelling and syntax errors in documentation and code samples
- Website UI that doesn't work

Your experience will help maintainers improve their tools and remove friction for the next developer. And remember, developer experience uses many tools and is different for everyone.

#### Using the Replayable CLI

The following shell script will open a GitHub issue with a clip of the last 30 seconds of your screen.

```sh
gh issue create -w -t "My Feedback" -b "`replayable --md`"
```

### Completing the Challenge (5 Points) <a id="points-complete"></a>

> 5 Points and Hall of Fame!

While Haxor is all about giving feedback, we still want to award those to complete the challenge successfully!

Every challenge will include some exit criteria that marks it as "complete." Once you successfully complete the challenge, you'll get added to the "Hall of Fame" via https://contrib.rocks/.

In order to get your github profile on the scoreboard and earn points for completing the challenge, you must:

1. Open a pull request that adds your name to the leaderboard
2. Attach a replay of you **demonstrating the exit criteria** to the PR

#### Using the Replayable CLI

```sh
echo 'Your Username' &>>README.md
git commit -am "Add my name to the leaderboard"
gh pr create -w -t "I Completed the Haxor Challenge" -b "`replayable --md`"
```

## Get Prizes <a id="cash-out"></a>

Haxor moderators get pinged on new submissions to the repositories and will comment on the issue or pull request to confirm your points.

Once you've earned enough points for a prize, you can cash out by simply emailing the Haxor staff with the prize you want, size (if appropriate), and your address.

Points will be deducted from your total (you can see this on in our leaderboard) and you'll get shipping notifications in your inbox.

# FAQ

## What does quality feedback look like?

(get examples from coda.io)

## What programming languages?

Currently the only languages we support are Javascript and Java.

## What's the story behind Haxor?

Haxor started when I wondered "how can we reward developers for participating in open source?" Then I realized that developer experience in itself was valuable to the maintainers of dev tools, but there wasn't a great way for developers to share their experience. So I started Haxor, an developer experience agency while building Replayable, a tool that makes sharing context instant.

For 3 years Haxors has privately been helping open-source projects and companies like AWS, Snap, and Mailchimp get feedback from developers who try their tools. Now we're excited to bring Haxor to the larger open-source community with the help of our scren recording tool, Replayable.

## How can I add my own challenge? <a id="add-challenge"></a>

Looking for feedback on yoru own API, SDK, or developer tool?

- For the [haxor-challenge-template](https://github.com/haxordx/haxor-challenge-template) repo.
- Make a new repo called `haxor-challenge-${your-tool}`
  - List an ETA (15 min - 2 hours)
  - Make guided a developer should follow to complete the challenge
- Make a pull request to the list above linking to your tool
  - We will approve or request changes to your challenge
- Developers will be notified of your new challenge!

### Requirements

Your challenge:

- Must be entirely self-service and publicly available
- Must not require payment details to complete
- Must target Javascript or Java developers (for now)
