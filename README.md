# Haxor DX Bounty

> Haxor is a community effort to help devtools maintainers improve their developer experience (DX).

## Welcome

Hello and welcome to the Haxor DX Bounty! 

As a member of Haxor, you get to try new developer tools, give the maintainers feedback, and **earn prizes**! Every bug we find helps the next developer save time! 

Here you level up and earn prizes by learning new APIs, SDKs, and developer tools. The feedback you provide helps maintainers improve their products, documentation, and resources.

Our feedback sessions are called challenges. Every challenge asks you to build a small app or add a single feature using a developer tool. Every challenge takes between 15 minutes to 2 hours and you complete them on your own machine, with your own IDE! So come learn new skills, help other developers, and earn some prizes along the way!

# How to Earn Points

Everyone is welcome to participate in our challenges. There are two ways to earn points in a Haxor Challenge.

## How we score

We use screen recorings to validate your submissions. You can use any tool to upload clips. 

We recommend Replayable, our own screen recorder we built to be the fastest and most seamless way for developers to share their screen.

> Replayable is a desktop replay buffer that makes it easy to share desktop clips in issues, pulls, and tickets. Replayable makes it super easy to add context without ruining your flow. Check out the Chrome Extension for GitHub and the CLI.

In order to earn points for your submission, it must contain a Replayable replay or screencast.

## Feedback (10 points, 30 points max per challenge)

Giving feedback to maintainers is the whole point of Haxor. It's as easy as opening a GitHub issue against the Haxor challenge repo. You can file feedback for anything that you feel is "friction" to completing your task:

- Things you expected to work that didn't
- Confusing or outdated instructions
- Spelling and syntax errors in documentation and code samples
- Website UI that doesn't work

Your experience will help maintainers improve their tools and remove friction for the next developer. And remember, developer experience uses many tools and is different for everyone.

### Using the Replayable CLI

```sh
gh issue create -w -t "My Feedback" -b "`replayable --md`"
```

- 10 Points for feedback
- Max 30 points awarded for feedback per challenge

## Completing the Challenge (5 points + Hall of Fame)

While Haxor is all about giving feedback, we still want to award those to complete the challenge successfully!

Every challenge will include some exit criteria that marks it as "complete." Once you successfully complete the challenge, you'll get added to the "Hall of Fame" via https://contrib.rocks/. 

In order to get your github profile on the scoreboard and earn points for completing the challenge, you must:

1. Open a pull request that adds your name to the leaderboard
2. Attach a replay of you **demonstrating the exit criteria** to the PR

### Using the Replayable CLI

```sh
echo 'Your Username' &>>README.md
git commit -am "Add my name to the leaderboard"
gh pr create -w -t "I Completed the Haxor Challenge" -b "`replayable --md`"
```

- 20 points for completion
- Max 20 points awarded per challenge

# Moderation

Haxor moderators get pinged on new submissions to the repositories and will reply to confirm your points. You can check the status of your submissions in this Airtable.

# About

Haxor started when I wondered "how can we reward developers for participating in open source?" Then I realized that developer experience in itself was valuable to the maintainers of dev tools, but there wasn't a great way for developers to share their experience. So I started Haxor, an developer experience agency while building Replayable, a tool that makes sharing context instant.

For 3 years Haxors has privately been helping open-source projects and companies like AWS, Snap, and Mailchimp get feedback from developers who try their tools. Now we're excited to bring Haxor to the larger open-source community with the help of our scren recording tool, Replayable.
